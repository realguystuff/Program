# Program, a virus that shares screens.

Let's cut to the chase. We want to spread awareness about viruses and scams, so we made this as a little virus example.

This program just **sends** data in Java; the Receiver is in C# for Windows Forms. I will soon create a GitHub repository for the Receiver.

This program runs in the background. Nothing else. It just shares your screen to somebody else.

To not allow any scammer simply download this and send it to someone for scamming reasons, we will not provide jar files for this.

This program uses JRE 17.0.3.1 2022-04-22 LTS.
